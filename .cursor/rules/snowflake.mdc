#  when running statement in Snowflake or when creating objects in Snowflake

- If the prompt specifies a database and schema **always** try to use those and don't decide to use another database and schema to complete the tasks.
- If you get permission related error messages when running statements against the specified database and schema, try the following:
    - Check if you have connected with the `accountadmin` role. If not, assume that role by issuing this command: `use role accountadmin`.
    - Connect to Snowflake and verify which role owns the database and schema.
    - Issue a `use role <owner>` statement to assume the role of the database and schema owner by replacing `<owner>` with the proper owner role name.
