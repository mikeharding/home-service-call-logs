# Rules for Using the Snowflake CLI

This document outlines the standard procedures for running commands and deploying objects to Snowflake. These rules should be followed for all related tasks.

## General Rules & Assumptions

-   **Always use the Snowflake CLI** to run statements on Snowflake.
-   Assume the **Snowflake CLI** (`snow`) is already installed and configured.
-   The default connection is named **`cursor-pat`** and uses a Programmatic Access Token. **You can omit the connection name** in commands unless a different one is explicitly specified.
-   The primary CLI configuration is located at `~/.snowflake/config.toml`.
-   Named connections are defined in `~/.snowflake/connections.toml`.
-   If a connection name is given, assume it is correctly configured in `connections.toml`. There is no need to ask for account details, credentials, or private key paths.
-   The Snowflake CLI command line reference is documented in docs/snowcli-command-reference.md so if you need additional context on the `snow` command parameters you should be able to find them there.

## Common CLI Commands

-   The main command is **`snow`**.

-   **Test a connection:**
    `snow connection test`
    *(This will use the default `pat` connection. If another connection is specified, use `-c <connection_name>`)*

-   **Run a single SQL statement:**
    `snow sql -q "<query_text>"`
    *(Example: `snow sql -q "SELECT * FROM my_table LIMIT 10;"`)*

-   **Run a SQL file:**
    `snow sql -f <filename>`
    *(Example: `snow sql -f ./scripts/my_script.sql`)*
